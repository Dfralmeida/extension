# Chrome Extension to fetch flights

> Google Chrome Extension that searches flights for multiples filters given by the user, such as multiple origin and destination cities, multiple dates,  multiple airline companies, number of adults, kids and babies. It also can send an email in case of finding rates under a given price and can save a CSV file with found rates.


## Getting Started

To test the extension locally, go to chrome://extensions, enable Developer mode and load app as an unpacked extension (select the extension folder). Then, it'll load the configuration file manifest.json and the extension should appear.

## TODO list

To evolve this app, there are several features that I already thought, such as:

- Add search by miles
- Add other known flight engines, for example, skyscanner or kayak
- Change all messages and labels to use locale
- Add possibility to search different flight legs in same flight (A -> B and C -> A)
- Save requests to re-enter them later

These are just the ones I thought, but you can help gather other useful features.
